# Overview
This is the Web version of my other DPMS project. This project is currently a work in progress and currently there is only a login screen.

Login Screen:
- Login accepts user input for a username and password. The input is validated through the database, and if the username and password are found, the main menu will be presented. If the username and/or password are incorrect, an error message will display.

Main Menu:
-Just prints a hello message.
